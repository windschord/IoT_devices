 * - SystemInitializer: Centralized management of all initialization processes
 * - MainLoop: Priority-based processing separation and timing control
 * - SystemState: Integrated management of global variables and services
 * 
 * Refactoring results:
 * - 933 lines ‚Üí 80 lines (91% reduction)
 * - Global variables ‚Üí Managed by SystemState singleton
 * - Initialization process ‚Üí Centralized in SystemInitializer class
 * - Loop processing ‚Üí Priority-based separation in MainLoop class

/**
 * @note Refactoring details
 * 
 * [Issues before migration]
 * - main.cpp: 933 lines (bloated)
 * - Global variables: 50+ items (difficult to manage)
 * - Initialization process: Complex dependencies (error-prone)
 * - Loop processing: Unclear priorities (performance issues)
 * 
 * [Improvements after migration]
 * - main.cpp: 80 lines (91% reduction)
 * - Global variables: Centralized management with SystemState
 * - Initialization process: Clear order and dependencies with SystemInitializer
 * - Loop processing: Priority-based separation with MainLoop (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
 * 
 * [Architecture improvements]
 * 1. Single Responsibility Principle: Each class has clear responsibilities
 * 2. Dependency Inversion: Loose coupling through interfaces
 * 3. Separation of Concerns: Separation of initialization, execution, and state management
 * 4. Testability: Each class can be tested independently
 * 
 * [Maintainability improvements]
 * - When adding new features: Modify only the corresponding class
 * - When fixing bugs: Clear scope of impact
 * - During code review: Easy to identify changes
 * - Reduced understanding time: Lower learning cost for new developers
